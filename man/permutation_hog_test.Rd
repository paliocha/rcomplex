\arguments{
\item{net1}{Network object for species 1 (output of \code{\link[=compute_network]{compute_network()}}).}

\item{comparison}{Data frame from \code{\link[=compare_neighborhoods]{compare_neighborhoods()}} --- raw p-values,
\strong{not} FDR-corrected. Used to define HOG structure and extract
effect sizes.}

\item{alternative}{Which tail to test: \code{"greater"} (default) for conservation
or \code{"less"} for divergence.}

\item{min_exceedances}{Besag & Clifford stopping parameter: stop permuting
once this many permutation statistics exceed (or fall below) T_obs.
Higher values give more precise p-values but take longer (default 50).}

\value{
A data frame with one row per HOG, ordered by p-value, with columns:

\item{n_sp1}{Number of unique species-1 genes (M)}
\item{n_sp2}{Number of unique species-2 genes (N)}
\item{T_obs}{Observed sum-of-fold-enrichments statistic}
\item{n_perm}{Number of permutations performed (may be < max_permutations

\description{
Tests each Hierarchical Ortholog Group (HOG) for co-expression conservation
(or divergence) using a gene-identity permutation null with adaptive stopping
(Besag & Clifford, 1991).
}
\section{Statistical method}{

The null hypothesis is that the specific gene identities in a HOG carry no
information about co-expression conservation: replacing the HOG's genes with
randomly chosen genes from the same networks would yield equally large
neighborhood overlap.

For each permutation, M random species-1 genes and N random species-2 genes
are drawn (matching the HOG's gene counts), and the sum-of-fold-enrichments
statistic T is computed over all M x N pair x direction combinations. The
permutation p-value is the fraction of permuted T values that exceed (or
fall below, for divergence) the observed T.

The Besag & Clifford (1991) sequential stopping rule terminates permutations
early once \code{min_exceedances} permutation statistics exceed T_obs,
providing efficient computation without sacrificing accuracy for clearly
significant or non-significant HOGs.
}

\section{Why not Fisher's method}{

Fisher's method for combining p-values assumes independent tests. Within a
HOG, pair-level hypergeometric tests share network neighborhoods (genes
co-expressed with one HOG member are often co-expressed with another) and
share the ortholog mapping. This non-independence inflates Fisher's statistic
and produces anti-conservative p-values. The permutation approach is exact
regardless of the dependency structure.
}

\section{Intersection modes}{

For networks with max(n1, n2) <= 100,000 genes, bit-vector intersection
with popcount is used for maximum throughput. For larger networks, a
flag-vector approach (sparse set/count/clear) avoids excessive memory use.
}

\section{Multiple testing correction}{

Q-values are computed using the Liang (2016) discrete q-value method via
\code{\link[DiscreteQvalue:DQ]{DiscreteQvalue::DQ()}}, which accounts for the discrete support of
Besag & Clifford p-values. The standard Storey & Tibshirani (2003)
pi0-adaptive method cannot be used here because the adaptive stopping
rule produces p-values that are valid (super-uniform under the null) but
\strong{not} uniformly distributed: the negative binomial stopping concentrates
null p-values in the 0.1--0.5 range and depletes the right tail
(p > 0.9), causing Storey's pi0 estimator to severely underestimate pi0.
The Liang method estimates pi0 using the discrete support structure and
is correctly calibrated (pi0 = 1 on null simulations).

\arguments{
\item{net1}{Co-expression network for species 1 (n1 x n1 matrix)}

\item{net2}{Co-expression network for species 2 (n2 x n2 matrix)}

\item{thr1}{Co-expression threshold for species 1}

\item{thr2}{Co-expression threshold for species 2}

\item{pair_sp1_idx}{0-based index into net1 for each ortholog pair}

\item{pair_sp2_idx}{0-based index into net2 for each ortholog pair}

\item{ortho_sp1_idx}{0-based net1 indices for full ortholog table}

\item{ortho_sp2_idx}{0-based net2 indices for full ortholog table}

\item{n_cores}{Number of OpenMP threads (default: 1)}
}
\value{
DataFrame with comparison results for each ortholog pair
}
\description{
For each ortholog pair, tests the overlap of co-expression neighborhoods
in both directions (sp1->sp2 and sp2->sp1) using hypergeometric tests.
All gene identifiers are 0-based integer indices (string mapping done in R).
